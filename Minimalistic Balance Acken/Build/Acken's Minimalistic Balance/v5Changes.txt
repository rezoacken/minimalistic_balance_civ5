Map (BETA) :
-NQMap has been "removed".
-Rework of the map generator functions, inspired or copied from NQMap :
There should be less bugs with the map scripts and I've also modified things to my liking.
Maps are more generous than the base game in amount of ressources and luxuries (for everybody).
Starting position should rarely be bad
Less jungles
Strategic balance always gives horses iron coal and oil
-Two new mapscripts AMBalance Continents and AMBalance Pangea which are modified from NQPangea:
More land (5% more land on standard) and sea levels have a bigger impact (58%, 66%, 74% amount of water tiles respectively).
Less mountains on 4B and 5B and less chains, more scattered
Islands in both scripts
There is a smoothness parameter which is set at high by default and will create a very "round" pangea in one big lump. If set at low it will create a more sinuous Pangea or continents.
There are two parameters for islands, numbers and size.
The mapscript avoids creating choke points for the Pangea script

AI:
-Reduced likelihood of the AI taking godess of protection
-The AI should offer a white peace if it has been at war for 20 turns without any unit lost and 40 turns without any city lost (from either side). (BETA)
-The AI should look at its overall score and modify its attitude a bit based on it, more friendly with low score civs and less friendly with high score civs.
-The AI should value a DoF a bit more before betraying and denouncing

Civilizations:
-Carthage
The African elephant now costs the same as the other horsemen UU (75) instead of 100
Carthage gets a special free harbor in every cities called the Cothon which gives +2 gold to every sea tiles instead of +1.
Carthage gets the same priority coastal bias as Venice
Quinquireme strength reduced by 1 (now 14)
Note that the Quinquireme got buffed with the Trireme making it already a very powerful early unit.
-Rome
The Legion strength was reduced by 1 (now 17).
The Balista was removed.
Rome now has a unique Amphitheater called the Forum costing no maintenance and giving +25% GPP.
Rome UA now gives +10% building production and +15% production for buildings already existing in Capital.
-Korea's UA only gives +1 science to specialists.

To do:
-Better AI diplomacy and coallitions, weak AIs more likely to form alliances against leaders.
-Rework great improvements ?
-Rework of or additional Reformation beliefs to make picking one early more attractive.
