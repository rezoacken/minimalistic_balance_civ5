Acken's Minimalistic Balance Project
ALL CHANGES ARE SUBJECT TO SUGGESTIONS AND CHANGES

1.AI changes:
-Better AI logic for great peoples.
-The logic for the AI growth bonus (above prince) has been changed. Instead of diminishing the growth threshold it now decreases food consumption.
-The AI should no longer use prophets to convert city if it accepted to stop spreading (untested, need testing)
-Made the weight discount for time bigger for techs. The AI should ignore cheap techs for a lot less longer.
-Better AI workers
-Better CitizenAI logic (what the citizens work) and should focus more on science and culture
-The AI should be less likely to build National wonders and 2 slot specialist buildings (guilds) in small cities
-The AI should build more growth buildings in small cities
-The AI should no longer sit too long (after 60 turns) on less than 4 cities.
-The deal AI will no longer put things they value at 0 in it when asking for the AI to rebalance (horses and iron) !
-Changed stupid AI logic for nukes (the AI basically was throwing a dice and mostly using them defensively)
-Due to an increase in AI performance some free techs were removed on King+
-The AI no longer has a bonus in production for projects (Apollo, Manhattan, Ship parts)
-The AI production bonus to units has been decreased by 5% for King+
-All difficulties AI start with 2 warrior minimum (still 3 on 7-8)
-New AI flavors and economic flavor modifiers
-AI units free XP has been reduced on level 7 and 8 to 20 instead of 30
-The deal AI has got some first changes: 
The valuation of bribe for war is now more complex and it should be harder to send away an AI that wants to kill you
You can no longer cheat the AI by getting white peace when it wants more
The AI should offer a white peace if it has been at war for 20 turns without any unit lost and 40 turns without any city lost (from either side).
-The AI should be more aggressive and willing to attack city states and other civilizations:
Improvement on AI decisiveness and Grand strategy choices
AI much more agressive on negative opinion and more opportunistic
The AI should now consider war against weak targets even if it is already at war
-Changed the deal mechanic surrounding gold. The AI now apply an interest rate to humans of 15% while the Humans apply a rate of 0%.
This mean that you can now give 30G for 1GPT but you will only get 26G if you give 1GPT.
This has repercursions on the deal values and with additional tweak we get: Luxuries are now worth 8gpt while Strategics are worth 1gpt.
-Completely overhauled the reckless expander diplomatic mod. It now depends on various factors (relationship, personality and approach) and return one of 4 values (new diplo texts).
-Improved the warmonger logic:
The negative hit now depends on relationships, distance, era, personalities. More to come.
-Added a (for now rudimentary) casus belli hidden variable making the first city a civ conquer free of any hate if: 
The civ was declared war upon
A friend of the civ was declared war upon
It also boosts the War approach so beware before stealing workers :) Text has been added in the opinion detail for it but has no direct opinion weight.
Casus Belli has a 50turns expiration
-Partial integration of Delnar_Ersike's Artificial Unintelligence v9
-The AI's tech exponent (see 10.) decreases with difficulty so that the AI no longer feel too much pain for expanding like crazy (or conquering)
-Influence from unit gifts are doubled (10 base, 20 if requested)
-Influence when killing units a CS is at war with near borders (needs testing and the message should tell you you killed a barb for now)
-It now takes 2 turns for a gifted unit to travel to a CS instead of 3
-Reduced slightly the default AI era scaling bonuses (further production cost reduction, further growth reduction etc) across all King+ levels.
-The AI no longer has any bonus for making wonders
-Other changes

2.Culture:
More culture from the empire to help secondary policies:
-Amphitheaters, Opera houses and Museums now give 1 more culture.
-Great works give 4 culture and 3 tourism
-The palace now generates 2 culture per turn
-City states culture has been reduced (same yields than religious CS)
-The exponent for culture cost has been reduced from 2.01 to 1.92
-The negative effect of different ideologies has been reduced to -25%
Note: The idea is to encourage the investment into culture and getting secondary trees. 
Also note that Aesthetics has a pretty strong boost to tourism.

3.Wide mechanics:
-The cost of National wonders have been increased but the per city costs have been decreased. Values varries per wonder.
-Additional cities now increase tech costs non linearily, they use a A*N^E function where A is the old penality for cities (5% for standard size), N the number of cities and E an exponent equal to 0.65.

Nuke strength two level damage (nuclear missile) is no longer an automatic kill but 50 + rand 25 + rand 35 (max 110, average 80)

-Strength per pop is 33 instead of 40
-The defense bonus from the palace has been slightly increased (4 instead of 2.5).

-Cities no longer make reduced damage to range units
-All units have now access to Cover 1 right away but the effect is reduced to 25% strength against ranged attacks.
-Ranged units have now a reduced cost of approximately 12% (-5 for archer up to -45 for bazooka)
-Early Ranged units have had their melee strength reduced and their range strength slightly reduced:
-Some early melee units and cavalry have had their strength increased
-Early siege units have had their melee strength increased to make them more resistant and compensate for a lack of mobility :
-Trireme strength was increased by 2
-Industrial and above ranged units now have a range of 2 but their melee and ranged strengths have been reduced
-Anti tank gun are 4 movement 60 strength but cost 350 instead of 300
-Helicopters are 80 strength
-Anti tank gun and helicopter vs-tank bonuses are reduced to 50%
-Some unique units adjustments.
-Some costs adjustment have been made to better reflect these changes

11.Miscelaneous:
-Map Changes:
-Partial integration of the NQMapScript
-Rework of the map generator functions, inspired or copied from NQMap :
There should be less bugs with the map scripts and I've also modified things to my liking.
Maps are more generous than the base game in amount of ressources and luxuries (for everybody).
Starting position should rarely be bad
Less jungles
Strategic balance always gives horses iron coal and oil

More land (5% more land on standard) and sea levels have a bigger impact (58%, 66%, 74% amount of water tiles respectively).
Less mountains on 4B and 5B and less chains, more scattered
Islands in both scripts
There is a smoothness parameter which is set at high by default and will create a very "round" pangea in one big lump. If set at low it will create a more sinuous Pangea or continents.
There are two parameters for islands, numbers and size.
The mapscript avoids creating choke points for the Pangea script
