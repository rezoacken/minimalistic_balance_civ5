Buildings :
-Constabulary and Police Station give 1 happiness.
-Caravansary gives 2 gold
-The CN Tower give one free musician instead of pop/happiness
-The pentagon also gives 1 free copy of your land units similarly to the terracota army
-The terracota army now gives 3 culture instead of 1

Misc :
-SS parts no longer require alluminum (mostly an AI buff here due to AI stupidity)
-Truly free great people

AI:
-Significant nerf to AI unit experience. They are closer to humans on Immortal and above difficulties with only 15 free and 25% bonus instead of 30free and up to 100% bonus.
-The AI should care more or less about your lands based on its meanness stat.
-AI will wait a bit more before pumping settlers

TODO:
-Give more modifier to AI behavior based on personality
-WC science and military options
